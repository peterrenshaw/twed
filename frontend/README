* Elm code for frontend of application
- based on this tutorial code
  <http://www.elm-tutorial.org/040_effects/effects_2.html>
- works in conjunction with backend/rserve.py

* compiling works as such
- SRC    source directory of elm code
- TARGET final destination of JavaScript output

  elm-make --output target/sourcename.js src/sourcename.elm
  cp target/sourcename.js ../js

- the js file is now read from the root *index.html* file
