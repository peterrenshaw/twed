2016MAY22
* installed on win machine

* install had to do following before make works 
- create dir js/
- create dir frontend/target
- elm-install elm-lang/html
- change to em.sh


* Elm graduated to 0.17, so read the updated tutorials
- <http://guide.elm-lang.org>


2016MAY01

* Elm code for frontend of application
- based on this tutorial code
  <http://www.elm-tutorial.org/040_effects/effects_2.html>
- works in conjunction with backend/rserve.py

* compiling works as such
- SRC    source directory of elm code
- TARGET final destination of JavaScript output

  elm-make --output target/sourcename.js src/sourcename.elm
  cp target/sourcename.js ../js

- the js file is now read from the root *index.html* file
