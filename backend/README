* change of focus. Elm graduated to 0.17 and now I'm
  working on hooking the front-end to a backend server
  that talks to twitter
* read ../INSTALL first


* to run:

    # build FRONTEND js from elm source
    $ twed/frontend/em.sh

    # install BACKEND, then run backend server
    $ twed/backend/py.sh
    $ twed/backend/rserve.py

* a simple server generating a 0-n integer on request to 
  path.
- takes into account CORS
- used in conjunction with ../frontend/src/effects2.elm
